# This is .env.example file which is synced to GitHub.
# DO NOT put any real API keys or secrets here!
# Instead, copy this file to .env and add your actual API keys there.
# Make sure to NEVER upload your .env file to GitHub or share it in any way.
# For production environments, it's recommended to store API keys
# in the hosting platform's environment variables or secrets management system,
# rather than in a local .env file. This enhances security and simplifies deployment.
